# Godot-Suika

This has been my quickest to complete Godot project yet; taking me about 3 hours to finish. It is very simple and instead of using fruit like in the original 'suika' game, this simply uses different coloured balls. 

Compared to my other projects so far, I believe I have learnt the most from this one and I am now even more excited to continue working with Godot.
